Indenting C++ code helps better convey the structure of the code to human readers, as opposed to the compiler that ignores indentation.

Indentation is similar as to creation of subsections in a text. Say that you are writing a report that in total is 50 pages long. Your report is divided into chapters and the chapters is in turn divided into sections and sub-sections. So there are in total three different levels and each of these have headers. You could make the report take up a lot fewer pages be removing these levels and the headers, but most readers would not appreciate this because the report would be much harder to read. In the same way will correctly indented code be easier to read.
