# Quiz Solution Chapter 11

Solution to the quiz in chapter 11 of the book Sams Teach Yourself C++ - 8th Edition.

## 1

If to force a derived class to always implement certain functions so shall we:

1. Declare an abstract base class, for example called Shape

2. Introduce pure virtual functions in the base class, for example area() and print()

3. Let the derived class inherit from the base class, for example Circle and Triangle can inherit from Shape

Now Circle and Triangle will be required to provide an implementation of the functions area() and print() for the program to compile.
