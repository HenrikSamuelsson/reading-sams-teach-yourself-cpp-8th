Solution to the quiz in chapter 2 of the book Sams Teach Yourself C++ - 8th Edition.

## 1

The problem in declaring `Int main()` in C++ is that the built-in integer type is called `int` and not `Int`.

C++ is case sensitive so it is important to always use the correct casing to avoid bugs in the programs.

## 2

A comment can be longer than one line by starting the comment with `/*` and ending it with `*/`.

Example of a multi line comment:

```cpp
/* A detailed comment with a lot of text so that it does not fit in one line and instead needs to span over multiple lines. The comment hence uses both a start comment symbol and a end comment symbol. 

The compiler will ignore all text between the comment symbols. */
```
