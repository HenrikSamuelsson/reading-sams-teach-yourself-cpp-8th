The main difference between an interpreter and a compiler is in how the human readable program code is translated into the machine code that the computer can execute. A compiler will take the whole program code as input and create an object file that then is linked to form an executable that can be run by the computer, but first after the entire process is done. An interpreter will instead read the program code line by line and translates it on the go to an instruction that the computer executes directly.
